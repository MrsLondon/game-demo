Scream Game

How the Game Works:
Objective: The player must survive while avoiding the masked killer. The player will make decisions such as where to hide to evade danger.
Clues: Players find clues along the way that can help them decide to avoid danger. These clues might be text-based (e.g., "The door is locked, find the key!") or visual indicators (e.g., a flashing light or open window).
Ending/Win Condition: The player wins by escaping the killer. If they make the wrong decision or fail to act in time, they lose on the third live since he has 3 (hearts)
Losing Condition: If the killer catches the player, the game ends, and the player can try again.

How to Play: Simple instructions:
Use the arrow keys to move.
Press "Enter" to select choices or actions.
Avoid the killer’s traps and make it to safety.

Win/Loss Conditions:
Win by surviving and escaping the killer.
Lose if the killer catches you.

Start: The game begins with a simple prompt and a short introduction (e.g., "You're in a spooky house. The killer is close. What do you do?").
First Decision: The player is presented with their first set of clues. For example:
Clue 1: "You hear footsteps behind you. Do you hide in the closet or run upstairs?"
Decision: The player must choose between hiding or running.
Right Decision: Hiding in the closet will keep the player safe.
Wrong Decision: Running upstairs leads to the killer’s location and results in losing a heart.
